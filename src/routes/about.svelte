  <p>So you two dig up, dig up dinosaurs? What do they got in there? King Kong?

God creates Man. Man destroys God. Man creates Dinosaurs.</p>
  <p>You really think you can fly that thing? You know what? It is beets. I've crashed into a beet truck. Forget the fat lady! You're obsessed with the fat lady! Drive us out of here! Is this my espresso machine? Wh-what is-h-how did you get my espresso machine?</p>
