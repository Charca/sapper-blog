title: 2018 Year in Review
date: "2019-03-12T07:25:00.000Z"
---

I know it's March already, **DON'T JUDGE ME**. I just really wanted to take some time to reflect on 2018 because, honestly, it was a fantastic year for me. There isn't a single reason why I think it was a particularly good year, but the collection of small achievements makes it _feel_ like a solid period of time.

It's the first time I write one of these, so I'm going to stick to a simple format (which I actually stole from my colleague [Karolina](https://thefox.is/2019/2018-year-in-review)). I'll try to keep it short and to the point, but I really can't make any promises ðŸ˜¬

## Work
I continued to work with the amazing team at Help Scout. We launched [Beacon 2.0](https://www.helpscout.com/live-chat/) last year, which is an embeddable JavaScript widget I've been working on for the past 18 months. It was a hard process, and it took way longer than any of us anticipated, but overall, I'm extremely happy with the way it turned out. This year my focus is on making the product even better, not only by working on new features but also by improving what we already shipped, especially regarding its performance.

I kept work stuff (i.e. coding) exclusively to my day job last year, but I'll try to change that in 2019. I've already been playing around with a couple of side-projects that I want to work on, mostly for learning purposes.  Hopefully, you'll read more about them in future posts!

## Writing
It wasn't until late August that I decided to make "start writing" one of my objectives for the year, which I kinda did by [starting this blog](https://charca.me/getting-started/). However, I only wrote two short posts in 5 months, so I can't really say I accomplished what I wanted to do.

This year I'm taking it more seriously. I know the key to writing more is to develop the habit of writing, which is why I'm making a deliberate effort to sit down and write for at least 30 minutes every single day. No exceptions. As I write these words, I'm on day 7 of my current streak. It's pretty damn hard, but I know the formula works. All I need to do is keep showing up every day, whether I feel like it or not, and just **trust the process**.

## Reading
The Goodreads Reading Challenge is one of the few measurable goals I set for myself every year, and it's also one that I consistently fail at. This year was different. I set a goal of reading 24 books in 2018, which was by far the most ambitious reading goal I had ever set for myself. I ended up reading [25 books](https://www.goodreads.com/user_challenges/11464846).

There wasn't really a topic last year. I've read books on everything from personal finance to minimalism and self-development. To my own surprise, I've ended up reading very few fiction books, which used to be my favorite category. I guess it had to do with my focus on productivity and self-development that, like it or not, make reading fiction seem like a waste of time. But I still see the value in them, and I actually really enjoy them. I'll try to make it a priority this year.

I'm not going to do a detailed review of all 25 books (I'll consider it for next year), but if you're curious, here's my top 5:

<br />

1. **[Sapiens](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23692271-sapiens)** by **Yuval Noah Harari**.

Hands down my favorite book of the year, and one that I'm definitely going to re-read at some point. There's no better way to understand humans than to understand its history as a species, and Harari does a great job walking us through all of it in a single 450-page book. If you haven't read it yet, I highly recommend it.

2. **[The Slight Edge](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/590652.The_Slight_Edge)** by **Jeff Olson**.

I've read quite a few books on the topic of habits, productivity, and self-development, and this one was probably my favorite of last year. I haven't read Atomic Habits yet, but for what I've heard about it, the message it conveys is very similar. If you liked James Clear's book and you're looking for a book along the same lines as Atomic Habits, give this one a read.

3. **[Machine Learning](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33503613-machine-learning)** by **Hugh Howey**.

I'm a fan of Howey's work, particularly Wool and the Silo saga, so when I discovered this collection of over 20 short stories (including some completely new Silo ones), I jumped right at it. Even if you haven't read anything from Howey before, you might find it a good read; although I _highly_ recommend skipping the Silo stories until you've read the Wool trilogy first.

4. **[The Richest Man in Babylon](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1052.The_Richest_Man_in_Babylon)** by **George S. Clason**.

When I started searching for personal finance books, this one came up every time. The advice it gives is pretty basic, but it does so in an entertaining and (at least for me) interesting way. Some people hate this book and I can see where they're coming from; it's a pretty short book, but for the advice it gives, it's longer than it should be. If you feel like learning a bit about Babylon, give it a read. If you're only interested in the personal finance aspect, just read a review.

5. **[The Miracle Morning](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17166225-the-miracle-morning)** by **Hal Elrod**.

This book is pretty cheesy, and I wouldn't say is a particularly _good_ book, but it did inspire me to develop a habit of waking up early and take advantage of the peace and tranquility during the first hours of the day. These days, I'm failing terribly at it, so I'll probably give it a re-read to see if inspiration hits me again.

## Health

In January I went to the doctor for my "yearly" checkup (yearly obviously meaning every 5 years), and the results I got back were very disappointing. I was overweight, my cholesterol was pretty high, and I was at risk of developing some serious fat boy health issues. I've always struggled with my weight, but until that point, it was only for cosmetic reasons. This time was different. My bad habits and poor diet were starting to kill me, literally. So I decided to go for a run.

I went for 5 runs, actually. Monday through Friday, no matter what. I decided that I was going to run every day, and I did it. Then I joined a CrossFit gym, and I decided that I was going to go to at least 3 classes each week, and I did that too. I started playing tennis, and more recently, squash as well. I ran my first 5K. I stopped drinking alcohol during weekdays, and I started eating a lot healthier (for which my wife should receive all the credit since she's the one who started _cooking_ healthier meals).

Now a year later, I lost 9 kilos (20 pounds), I built some muscle, and I can do a proper [snatch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xQp2sldyts). The numbers are really nothing to brag about, but the fact that I was able to develop the habit of exercising every day, is quite fascinating to me.

It's hard to say were all the self-discipline came from. Fear is a great motivator, of course, but there was also something else that I can't quite put my finger on. All I know is that if a lazy ass like me can develop this habit, then virtually anyone can do it as well.

## Travel
It was a good year for traveling. And by good, I mean right at that sweet spot before it starts to become exhausting. Between Help Scout's team retreats, vacations with Patricia and some wandering on my own, I ended up visiting 16 cities in 5 countries last year. 11 of them for the first time.

- Buenos Aires, Argentina (a few times)
- Salta, Argentina
- Jujuy, Argentina
- Scottsdale, AZ
- Los Angeles, CA
- San Diego, CA
- Hilton Head, SC
- Charleston, SC
- Savannah, GA
- Paris, France
- Madrid, Spain
- Granada, Spain
- Seville, Spain
- Lisbon, Portugal
- Porto, Portugal
- Barcelona, Spain

This year is going to be a lot lighter (you'll read the reason why in a minute). I'll be coming back to Lisbon in a few weeks (this time for Help Scout's Spring Retreat), and we're probably going to be doing a trip to California with Patri sometime this year. Other than that, we're going to keep things local.

## Personal

The highlight of 2018 came right before it was about to end. In October, Patricia and I found out that we're going to become parents for the first time this year, and we couldn't be more thrilled about it. Also, I think I've never been so scared of anything in my life. It's a strange feeling. Four months from now we'll be responsible for an actual human baby, which doesn't seem like a scary thing until it happens to you.

We know our lives are going to change drastically over the next year. It's an exciting and at the same terrifying feeling. But this is how we grow, and we're welcoming the change with open arms and an open heart. We're as ready as we'll ever be.

## What's Next?

Following last year's recipe, the theme of 2019 will continue to be personal development, with a focus on improving productivity and avoiding distractions. I don't really like setting arbitrary new year resolutions, but I do like to set some goals for myself based on what I know I can achieve, primarily to keep me on track throughout the year:

- **Develop the habit of writing.** Specifically, create more content for this blog and Help Scout's Engineering publication on Medium.
- **Graduate from college.** I've been taking classes since May of last year, and I'm now 20 credits away from getting a BS Degree in Data Science and Analytics, which I'll hopefully complete sometime before June.
- **Complete the Goodreads 2019 Challenge.** This year with a slightly more ambitious goal of 30 books.
- **Start a side project.** With school taking all of my focus the first half of the year, and the baby coming in July, it doesn't look like I'm going to have a lot of free time to work on anything outside of my day job. Nonetheless, I'm committed to finding some room to at least start working on one.

That is all for now; thank you for reading. I hope last year was as good for you as it was for me, and I sincerely wish you the best for 2019... or what's left of it, anyways ðŸ˜…
